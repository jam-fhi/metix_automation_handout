# Automation Handout

Autonomiae Amittit Auream (or TripleA) is a web studio that offers automation testing services. They are developing their public website, and though they are on the early stages of development, management is pleased with the progress so far, but concerned about the quality of the page.

Management top requirements are: 

* All forms should be validated
* Clearly identified by labels at all times
* and placeholders are to be used if suitable.
* The website must use the graphical resources provided by Marketing (gifs).

Management expects a 1337% sales increase once the new page is released.

### Tasks:

1. Create and automate a test suite from the provided sample web page. Be sure to document your process and describe the testing matrix you are referencing. The output of your solution should be a reporting dashboard and should contain a summary of the execution.

2. The sample web page has three pages. Look for inconsistencies in the styles or the common elements of the page. Ensure that field validation is implemented before submission. Use assumptions as needed.

3. The info page loads data from an attached JSON. Treat this as your persistence layer. Ensure that all the contents of the JSON are being displayed in the page.

4. You can do minor code changes to implement a test. Make sure to document whatever code change you do!

### What weâ€™re looking for:

For these tasks, we are interested in your development journey - show us the steps you took to identify issues, the first glance at your test matrix, assumptions, and the reasoning behind your preferred mechanism to present results.

### Tools:

Feel free to use whatever web automation tools you need, if possible use Selenium as your base framework.
